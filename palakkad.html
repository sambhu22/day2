        <p>Palakkad  formerly known as Palghat, historically known as Palakkattussery is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Kerala. It is the administrative headquarters of the Palakkad District. Palakkad is most densely populated municipality and fourth densely populated city in Kerala. It was established before Indian independence under British rule and was known by the name Palghat. Palakkad is famous for the ancient Palakkad Fort, which is situated at the heart of the city and was captured and rebuilt by Hyder Ali in 1766. The city is situated about 347 kilometres (216 mi) northeast of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.

            The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat, and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the Ratholsavam chariot festival. The river Bharathappuzha flows through Palakkad.[3] Palakkad is located on the northern bank of Bharathappuzha River.[3]
