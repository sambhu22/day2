        <h4> <u>kozhikode</u> </h4>
        <p>Kozhikode , also known in English as Calicut, is a city along the Malabar Coast in the state of Kerala in India. It has a corporation limit population of 609,224[6] and a metropolitan population of more than 2 million, making it the second largest metropolitan area in Kerala and the 19th largest in India.[9] Kozhikode is classified as a Tier 2 city by the Government of India.[10]

            It is the largest city in the region known as the Malabar and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district. In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point for Indian spices.[1] It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Persians, the Arabs and finally the Europeans.[11] According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second best city in India to live in.[12</p>
